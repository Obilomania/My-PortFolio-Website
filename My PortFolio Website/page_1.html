          My name is Obinna Ishmael Iloanya, I am from Nigeria and i live in Nigeria. I am a web Developer, A graphics
          Designer, A Music producer, a sound Engineer and a Social media Marketer, so its safe to say i am jack of many
          trades, lol. I first Ventured into the world of Tech in 2012 and started with python but i was still very
          young and playful so i left and During the Covid 19 Crisis and The lockdown, i got a wake up call to go back
          into tech and since i am good with Designs and photo manipulation i decided to go back into tech as a FrontEnd
          Web Developer since it has to do with mostly User Interface and how it functionality. I started with studying
          some books and then in March 2021; i started taking courses from Udemy, W3School and Youtube. I dont have much
          Experience but i know i am a fast learner and also believe there is a solution to everything in tech, it all
          depends on how deep you would want to make your research. I got my first Client as a freelancer in june 2021,
          it was tough but i had to study and watch tutorials to make it work, they were impressed with the design and
          its functionality but to me it was looking funny because i felt i could do better, I rebuilt the website
          though and its well animated. Well to cut The Long Story short; This is Me and i am the Masked Developer.
